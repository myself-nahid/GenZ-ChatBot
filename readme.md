# GenZ-ChatBot
This project implements a contextual chatbot capable of answering user queries using data scraped from the GenZMarketing website. The chatbot leverages Streamlit, LangChain, FAISS, HuggingFace Embeddings, and ChatGroq for data retrieval and contextual understanding.

## Features

- Web-based Interface: Built using Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.

- Data Preprocessing: Handles CSV data with error handling.

- Vector Embeddings: Utilizes HuggingFace's all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for text vectorization.

- Vector Database: FAISS is used for efficient similarity searches.

- Language Model Integration: ChatGroq LLM for generating context-based responses.

- Document Splitting: Recursive character splitting for better vectorization and retrieval.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/myself-nahid/GenZ-ChatBot.git
cd GenZ-ChatBot
```
2. Install Dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set Environment Variables:
Create a .env file with the following:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
```
4. Run the Application:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
## Usage

- Click the Document Embedding button to create vector embeddings.

- Enter a query in the input box and receive a context-based answer.

## Key Components

- Data Preprocessing: Cleans the CSV file before vectorization.

- Vector Storage: FAISS for efficient document storage and retrieval.

- LLM Integration: ChatGroq for generating responses.

- Embeddings: HuggingFace's all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for vectorization.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the .env file is correctly set up.

- Run pip install -r requirements.txt if modules are missing.
